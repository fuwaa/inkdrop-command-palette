## Changelog

#### 1.0.0 - 08/24/2022

- Initial release, yay!

## Ideas

- [ ] configurable settings? I don't know what to put here though...

## Todo

- [ ] ability to use commands that require an argument, **requires a bit of reverse engineering**
- [ ] finalize decision on whether i should isolate commands such as `focus on ****` because we'd be already focusing on it or have another command invokable related to it that works targeted by the selector[^3].
- [ ] code documentation/prettify to make it less stressful on the eyes.
- [ ] find a way to make commands that rely on native stuff target the proper selector, as of now i could only rule this as a javascript DOM limitation (still researching on it though!)

###### 1: Current version is limited to only default keybindings, planned support for user defined `keymaps.cson` is in the works.

###### 2: Provided that the plugin developer provides support for their command via `lib/commands/plugins.js`

###### 3: For now, if you search for a command like that, it won't show anything but it's always visible on the full list, oh and you can't invoke it either.
